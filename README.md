As data size and complexity continue to grow, efficient clustering techniques are essential for meaningful analysis. Having provided necessary theoretical base, this thesis evaluates the performance of spectral clustering algorithms—both standard and normalized Laplacian-based—against the traditional k-means algorithm. While k-means proves computationally efficient for simpler datasets, its accuracy declines as data complexity increases. Spectral clustering methods, particularly the normalized Laplacian approach, demonstrate superior clustering quality, achieving the highest Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). However, this comes at a higher computational cost. The findings suggest that k-means remains preferable for low-dimensional datasets, whereas spectral clustering is more suitable for high-dimensional, complex data requiring greater accuracy.
